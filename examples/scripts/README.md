Scripts provide a way to have simple sequence of events happen on command.

They are run separately from the parlay system. Therefore the parlay system needs to be initialized and running before
the script is run. In order to run these examples the steps are:

run run.py to start the parlay system
run script.py to run the script



The items that the example scripts are controlling will be writen in python for simplicity's sake but they could be
talking to any device over ethernet, serial, bluetooth, etc.
